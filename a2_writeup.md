# Assignment 2 - Write UP

## Description
This assignment is about learning and applying the while loop and iterating through multiple lists at a time.  We also will discuss how we match things in chatbots in order to extract what a user is trying to find.  Next assignment we will work with data bases and how we can extract information from them.

## What to complete
1. Go through the notes.py file w/ Mr. Berg
2. Complete `a2.py`, Mr. Berg will walk everyone through the process
3. Make sure you pass all asserts in `a2.py`
4. Complete the reflection problems below
5. Push your code to github for grading

## Reflection Questions
1. What was difficult for you while completing the match function?
the naming was a little weird and im a lot more used to java syntax and it was a little hard for me to follow wha the code was doing, but its was ok after going through things one by one


2. Explain how you could use the match function for extracting information from a movie database.

you could use the match function in the movie data base by having some key words replace some things. make the x,y,z be words like, movie, time, date, etc that you could match to. the _ and % could then be the things your looking for like a date.
